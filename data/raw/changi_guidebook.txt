Changi Airport also shimmered with new tenants.
Throughout this journey, the spirit of the ONE Changi
community stayed strong. Staff, airlines and airport
partners united to uphold the world-renowned service
excellence that defines Changi. This unwavering
dedication was celebrated with several awards throughout
the year, reaffirming Changi’s status as the pinnacle of
enchantment worldwide.
As we reflect on the journey behind us and look ahead to
the horizons beyond, one thing remains certain – the magic
of travel endures. So, join us as we rediscover that magic,
one destination at a time.

VISION, MISSION
AND VALUES
CHANGI AIRPORT GROUP 13
Financial year 2023/24 was a
remarkable journey for Changi
Airport Group (CAG) as we
transitioned from the challenges
of Covid-19 to a recovery period
marked by volatile economic
conditions, high interest rates,
and evolving consumer behaviour.
Despite these headwinds, I am
proud to report that CAG has
emerged stronger and more
resilient, charting a course of
recovery that has exceeded our
expectations.
Changi as a leading air hub
The Changi air hub has been
at the heart of this resurgence.
2023/24 marked a significant
milestone, with 62.5 million
passenger movements, reflecting a
remarkable 46% growth from the
previous year. I am happy to report
that we surpassed pre-Covid levels
in the final quarter of the financial
year, emerging as the fifth busiest
international airport globally
by seat capacity1
. This recovery
underscores our resilience and
reaffirms our pivotal role as a
global aviation hub.
Our commitment to enhancing
Changi’s connectivity to the
world remained unwavering. We
welcomed two new passenger
airlines, Aero Dili from Timor Leste
and TransNusa from Indonesia,
and established new links to
India’s Bhubaneswar and China’s
Beijing Daxing Airport. These
additions expanded our network
and reinforced our status as a key
gateway to the Asia-Pacific region.
In a concerted effort to restore
connectivity, we reinstated links
to many destinations, expanding
Changi Airport’s network to
over 150 cities, served by more
than 90 airlines operating
over 6,700 weekly flights. To
promote Singapore as a stopover
destination, the Free Singapore
Tour was relaunched with a new
Changi Precinct Tour to showcase
the vibrancy of our island’s east.
In cargo operations, we handled
1.8 million tonnes of airfreight
throughput during the year, placing
12th
globally for international cargo
traffic and cementing our position
as the busiest cargo airport in
Southeast Asia. The addition of
four new freighter airlines and
several strategic partnerships
underscored our commitment
to bolstering air logistics. This
included a Memorandum of
Understanding with Brussels
Airport Company to improve
pharmaceutical air logistics and
set new industry standards for
excellence.
Improved financial and
commercial performance
CAG’s financial results for 2023/24
reflect continued recovery and
growth. Total revenue rose 45%
to S$2,727 million, driven by
the strong return in air travel
demand. Revenue from the
airport’s concessions recovered
more slowly due to lower spending
amid inflationary pressures and
global economic uncertainty.
Nonetheless, EBITDA increased
60% to S$1,205 million, and
net profit after tax grew to
S$431 million.
With increased passenger
movements, CAG also seized
Changi emerged stronger
with the highest international
passenger traffic recovery in
2023 for the Asia-Pacific region.

MESSAGE FROM
THE CHAIRMAN
the opportunity to elevate
customer experience with
new innovative retail concepts
such as an interactive
sommelier, robot barista, and
unmanned convenience store.
Our e-commerce platform,
iShopChangi, expanded to
incorporate over 2,000 brands,
enriching the shopping experience
for discerning travellers and
residents. This expansion included
off-airport merchants, allowing us
to offer diverse and more high-
quality shopping options.
A rejuvenated Terminal 2
On 1 November 2023, CAG
celebrated the reopening of
Terminal 2 (T2), marking a key
milestone in our infrastructure
development. Inspired by nature,
T2’s design incorporates natural
materials and lush greenery to
create a serene environment.
The expansion added over
21,000 square metres, increasing
Changi Airport’s capacity to
90 million passengers per annum.
Enhancements included nearly
doubling the number of automated
check-in kiosks and bag drop
machines, introducing automated
Special Assistance Lanes, and
constructing a new mega Early
Baggage Storage facility. Our
efforts were recognised with
the Building and Construction
Authority’s Universal Design
Excellence Award and the BCA
Green Mark Platinum award.
The engineering works undertaken
for T2 also involved significant
upgrades to critical systems and
building equipment, ensuring
that the terminal remains at
the forefront of efficiency and
sustainability. The introduction
of 27 new-to-Changi brands
has diversified the tenant mix,
enhancing passenger experience.
These new offerings provide a blend
of local and international brands,
catering to a wide range of tastes
and preferences.
Innovations and operational
enhancements
Elsewhere in Changi Airport’s
terminals, there were
enhancements, emphasising
The refreshed T2 includes several new experiences, including ‘Flap Pix’, an installation which features the iconic mechanical split-flap flight
information board.
The debut of Jones the Grocer, Changi Airport’s first landside duplex cafe, has brought much
excitement to the departure hall in T2.

safety, innovation, and efficiency.
The deployment of autonomous
cleaning robots and a new
Enterprise Data Platform Plus
to collect and analyse data in
near real-time are examples of
our efforts to raise operational
efficiency while maintaining a high
standard of service. Key milestones
also included operationalising
Runway 2 with upgraded
safety systems and pioneering
technologies like the Casualty
Evacuation Bot for emergency
passenger evacuations.
To accommodate the increasing
volume of air traffic, new aircraft
parking stands were constructed,
and we commenced trials for fully
automated aerobridges, which
will improve the disembarkation
process and reduce manpower
requirements. At Seletar Airport,
the introduction of the Single
Runway Frequency system has
streamlined runway operations
and significantly improved safety.
Additionally, integrating drones
for inspection and maintenance
has increased precision and
reduced costs.
CAG’s subsidiaries
CAG’s subsidiaries Jewel Changi
Airport (Jewel) and Changi Airports
International (CAI) have been
instrumental in amplifying our
global footprint. Jewel continued
to attract much attention in news
and social media during the year,
enjoying a 26% year-on-year
increase in footfall. Collaborations
with the Singapore Tourism
Board have elevated Jewel into
a destination in its own right,
offering carefully curated products
and dining experiences that
highlight the best of Singaporean
culture.
CAI’s recent story has been one
of transformative partnerships
and impactful initiatives.
Leveraging our expertise in
airport management, we inked
strategic agreements with
airports in Angola, Egypt and
Vietnam. These partnerships aim
to enhance airport performance,
grow non-aeronautical revenue,
and foster international route
development. CAI will continue
to explore opportunities to share
CAG’s expertise and standards of
excellence with airports around
the world.
The way forward
Even as we build on the recovery
of air traffic at Changi Airport, CAG
today faces unique conditions
in our operating environment.
Innovation remains the
cornerstone of our future success

MESSAGE FROM
THE CHAIRMAN
and it is being pursued across
all our business and operations.
These cross-disciplinary efforts are
focused on developing bold
solutions to enhance the capacity
of Changi’s existing terminals,
as well as to meet the major
challenges facing our air hub, such
as climate change, manpower
constraints, and evolving customer
expectations.
Looking ahead, the construction
of Terminal 5 (T5) is set to
commence in 2025, following the
launch of the first construction
tender in March 2024 for the T5
substructure. Initiatives like the
T2 Connection (linking T5 to T2)
and new ways of baggage handling
will ensure seamless passenger
and baggage transfers between
terminals. We are testing robotic
solutions such as the Auto-Dolly
and Auto-DollyTug, as well as
implementing autonomous loading
and unloading of Unit Load
Devices at aircraft stands. When
fully developed, these innovations
will ensure that Changi Airport
remains ready to meet the growing
demands of global air travel
and ensure that Changi Airport
continues to set the standard
for operational excellence and
passenger service.
Our commitment to sustainability
remains unwavering. This year, we
raised our carbon emissions target
from the previous Zero Carbon
Growth to a 20% reduction in
Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030,
against a 2019 baseline. This is
in line with the target set by the
authorities for domestic aviation
emissions under the Singapore
Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint. The
installation of a solar photovoltaic
(PV) system on Changi Airport’s
rooftops, set to be the largest
single-site rooftop solar PV system
in Singapore when completed in
2025, marks a significant step in
our commitment to sustainable
operations. Alongside this, we are
proud to introduce ‘Changi Carbon
Offsets’—our very own carbon-
offset programme for travellers.
These initiatives are pivotal in
our ongoing efforts to utilise
renewable energy extensively and
to reduce the aviation industry’s
carbon footprint.
Appreciation
Mr Lee Seow Hiang, who has
been Chief Executive Officer since
CAG’s corporatisation in 2009,
steps down on 1 July 2024. I would
like to extend my heartfelt thanks
to Seow Hiang for his remarkable
15 years of leadership. His
vision and dedication have been
instrumental in positioning Changi
Airport as a world leader among air
hubs. Under his stewardship, we
saw the construction of Terminal
4, upgrades to Terminals 1 and
2, and the realisation of Jewel.
These significant developments,
coupled with efforts to expand
Changi’s network of airlines
and destinations, have garnered
global acclaim, earning Changi
numerous Best Airport awards.
Seow Hiang also led CAG through
the unprecedented challenges of
Covid-19, ensuring we emerged
stronger and more resilient. The
Board and I wish him the very best
in his future endeavours.
The Board would also like to thank
Brigadier-General Kelvin Fan who
stepped down as a Director in
March 2024. We are grateful for
his valuable contributions and
counsel during his tenure.
With air travel expected to
continue growing in the future, we
remain mindful that the industry
is still volatile and fast-changing.
Nonetheless, we look forward to
achieving full recovery in Changi
Airport’s passenger traffic before
long. This confidence stems
from the strong foundation and
resilience demonstrated by our
team and all our partners who
have worked closely with CAG to
drive Changi’s long-term growth.
Together, we will continue
to navigate challenges, seize
opportunities, and elevate Changi
Airport to even greater heights.

Year In Review
Financial year 2023/24 was a
significant milestone for Changi
Airport’s recovery. For the first time
since the onset of the pandemic,
Changi Airport saw its passenger
numbers surpass pre-Covid levels
during the last quarter of the
financial year. The robust demand
for air travel during the year was led
by the rebound in Northeast and
Southeast Asia traffic. Boosted by
the recovery in passenger traffic at
Changi Airport, the Group’s revenue
rose 45% to S$2,727 million.
Over the last two years as passenger
traffic continued to recover, Changi
Airport progressively reopened
terminals as part of a measured
approach to meet capacity demands
as well as manage terminal operating
costs. With full recovery
in sight, Changi Airport celebrated
the reopening of the expanded
Terminal 2 (T2), marking the full
restoration of Changi’s four-terminal
operations. The Group’s operating
expenses rose by 20% to S$2,233
million with the increased level of
business activities.
Overall, the Group saw an
improvement in its financial
performance as EBITDA and net
profit attributable to the shareholder
of the Company increased to
S$1,205 million and S$431 million
respectively.
Group Operating Revenue
With the recovery in travel demand,
passenger traffic at Changi Airport
continued to grow steadily during
2023/24, gaining momentum in
the last quarter to surpass pre-
Covid levels. The strong traffic
performance in the last quarter
was boosted by the hosting of
major events in Singapore and
liberalisation of visa requirements
between China and Singapore.
Changi Airport also collaborated
closely with airline partners to
drive air traffic and connectivity,
restoring almost 90% of pre-Covid
city links. For the whole of 2023/24,
passenger movements reached 62.5
million or 91% of pre-Covid levels,
with air traffic movements totalling
344,000 or 90% of pre-Covid levels.
Revenue from the Group’s airport
service fees increased by 53%
to S$1,344 million, driven by the
growth in passenger traffic and
phased increase in chargeable rates
that helped to support Changi’s
operations, development plans
and upgrading of existing
infrastructure that continued
throughout the pandemic.
Airport concession and rental
income improved by 48% in
2023/24 to reach S$1,042 million,
but recovery was slower due to
lower passenger spending amid
inflationary pressures and global
economic uncertainty. Despite
the challenges, Changi continued
to enhance its retail shopping
experience and added more than
40 new brands at Changi.
At Jewel Changi Airport, large-scale
marketing activations in partnership
with popular brands like Marvel and
Nintendo were launched. These
efforts, combined with a refreshed
tenant mix, contributed to increased
footfall and sales compared to the
previous year. As a result, Jewel’s
revenue increased 14% year-
on-year (yoy).
On the back of travel recovery,
Changi Travel Services, which offers
travel-related products and services
through its consumer-facing brand,
Changi Recommends, experienced
steady increase in its sales of travel
essentials such as local SIM cards,
Wi-Fi routers and transport cards,
as well as sales of local attractions’
tickets to international travellers.
Changi Airports International, the
consultancy and investment arm of
the Group, also saw an increase in
its revenue as it continued to forge
new partnerships and signed several
consultancy agreements during the
year with overseas airports such
as Cairo International Airport and
regional airports in Angola.
Overall, Group revenue grew 45%
to S$2,727 million.

Group Expenditure
In tandem with the recovery in
passenger traffic and restoration
of full four-terminal operations at
Changi Airport, the Group’s operating
expenses increased by 20% yoy to
S$2,233 million in 2023/24.
T2 was fully reopened in November
2023 after three and a half years
of extensive engineering and
expansion works, boosting the
airport’s total handling capacity to
90 million passengers per annum.
With the recovery of air traffic at
Changi Airport, services and licence
fees charged by the Civil Aviation
Authority of Singapore were also
fully reinstated.
To navigate the headwinds of
escalating cost pressures from
inflation and labour shortages,
the Group continued its focus on
innovation initiatives, leveraging
automation and technology to
boost operational productivity and
efficiency. For instance, T2 was
reconfigured to provide greater
convenience to passengers with
increased automated check-in kiosks
and bag drop machines. The Group
also experimented with various
innovative solutions such as the fully
automated passenger loading bridges
and the use of artificial intelligence
and machine learning to enhance the
speed and accuracy for the security
screening of hand-carry baggage.
These technological advancements
automate labour-intensive tasks and
augment the workforce to increase
manpower productivity.
To improve energy efficiency and
shift towards renewable and cleaner
energy sources, the Group upgraded
airport buildings and systems
with best-in-class energy-efficient
models and expanded support for
the airport community to switch to
cleaner energy vehicles. The Group
also continued to advance its solar
efforts with the commencement of
the installation of Singapore’s largest
rooftop solar photovoltaic system in
one location.
EBITDA and Net Profit
The Group’s EBITDA grew by 60% to
reach S$1,205 million and net profit
attributable to the shareholder of the
Company grew to S$431 million
in 2023/24.
Financial Position
As at 31 March 2024, the Group’s
asset base grew to S$14,347
million, with more than two-thirds
comprising capital asset investments
in property, plant and equipment as
well as investment property. During
the year, the Group invested over
S$800 million to upkeep and upgrade
the airport’s facilities, as well as to
fund the expansion of T2 and the
development of Changi East.
With significant capital investment
outlay for the Changi East
development underway, the Group
continued to stay prudent and
focussed on rebuilding its financial
resilience and cash reserves. As
at 31 March 2024, cash and cash
equivalents for the Group totalled
S$2,115 million, while loans and
borrowings amounted to
S$1,925 million.
Total equity attributable to the
shareholder of the Company grew
by S$378 million to reach
S$6,637 million.
Outlook
Looking ahead, the Group remains
cautiously optimistic that Changi
Airport will be able to achieve
100% recovery of pre-Covid traffic
in 2024/25. While the outlook for
aviation is promising as demand for
air travel continues to be healthy
in the first quarter of 2024/25, the
Group remains mindful that the
industry operates in a highly volatile
and fast-changing environment. To
stay ahead, the Group will continue
to invest in its infrastructure as well
as innovative solutions.
The Group remains committed
to exercising financial prudence
even as it continues to face cost
pressures from inflation and escalating
manpower costs. The Group will also
continue to work closely with the
aviation community and government
agencies to strengthen Singapore’s
position as a leading air hub as it
forges ahead to achieve long-term
sustainable growth.

A YEAR OF
REMARKABLE RECOVERY
Financial year 2023/24 was a year
of remarkable recovery for Changi
Airport. Fuelled by a surge in travel
demand that was evident across
the globe, there was an upswing in
both outbound and inbound travel.
62.5 million passenger movements
were registered in 2023/24, a 46%
growth from the previous year.
Changi emerged stronger with the
highest international passenger
traffic recovery in 2023 for the
Asia-Pacific region. It also secured
its position as the fifth busiest
airport in the world by seat capacity,
according to global travel data
provider, OAG.
Strengthening Changi’s global
network
CAG stayed focused on enhancing
Changi’s connectivity to bolster
its position as a premier air hub.
Two new passenger airlines joined
the Changi family – Aero Dili from
Timor Leste and TransNusa from
Indonesia. Changi also established
a new city link to Bhubaneswar
in India, and a new service link to
China’s Beijing Daxing Airport.
Several airlines added new city
links to their network. Notably, Thai
AirAsia launched its Hat Yai service,
previously operated solely by Scoot,
offering passengers a wider range of
choices. Additionally, Air India and
IndiGo started new daily services
to Bangalore and Hyderabad,
respectively. With the addition of
Bhubaneswar, Changi is the most
connected hub to India across
Southeast Asia with 17 city links,
surpassing pre-Covid levels.
Changi also actively engaged its
airline partners to encourage
them to fully reinstate their pre-
Covid flight frequencies and seat
capacities. This led to capacity
surpassing pre-pandemic levels for
some routes.
As of March 2024, Changi restored
its connectivity to over 150 city
links, served by more than 90
airlines, with over 6,700 weekly
flights.
Strategic partnerships and
campaigns to promote travel
Recognising the importance of
the China market, a tripartite
partnership between CAG, Sentosa
Development Corporation and the
Singapore Tourism Board (STB)
was inked to promote Singapore’s
iconic attractions in Sentosa and
the seamless travel experience
at Changi Airport to Chinese
travellers. CAG also strengthened
its relationship with leading online
travel agencies like Trip.com,
Traveloka and Tiket through several
Memoranda of Understanding to
collaborate on inbound campaigns
to attract Chinese and Indonesian
tourists.
Additionally, CAG stirred up
wanderlust with its ‘Shall We Just
Go?’ travel campaign that promoted
the thrill of spontaneous travel.
Working with Trip.com, the 12-
week initiative saw over 85,000
participants vying for a chance to
win an impromptu adventure to
one of six destinations – Cebu,
Ho Chi Minh City, Jeju, Penang,
Phnom Penh, or Surabaya. Besides
stimulating travel demand, it helped
to raise the profile of Southeast
Asian airlines that operated in
Changi.
Boosting Changi’s
attractiveness as a transit hub
The much anticipated Free
Singapore Tour programme
returned, as Changi positioned
itself as a destination beyond
just a transit point. Existing tour
itineraries, including the City
Sights Tour and Heritage Tour,
were revitalised to include new
points of interest. A brand-new
Changi Precinct Tour was added
to unveil the vibrant cultural and
historical side of Singapore’s
eastern region surrounding Changi
Airport. This tripartite collaboration
with Singapore Airlines and STB
aimed to entice transit passengers
to discover the unique charm of

CAG’s booth at trade shows allowed Air Hub Division and their Changi aviation partners to have
deeper discussions with overseas contacts.
Singapore, in hope of converting
them into potential future visitors
and contribute to Singapore’s
overall tourism efforts.
CAG also anticipated the return
of the fly-cruise passengers
post-Covid. Under a three-year
partnership between Marella
Cruises, STB and TUI Airways,
the airline will operate thrice-
weekly services from Birmingham,
London-Gatwick and Manchester
to Singapore between December to
April each season, for three years
from 2024 to 2026.
Deepening relationships with
industry stakeholders
To build top-of-mind awareness in
the aviation sector, CAG resumed
participation in trade shows held
abroad and locally to meet up with
airline and aviation community
partners.
As global travel rebounded, CAG
also recognised the concerted
efforts and resilience of the
aviation industry at the annual
Changi Airline Awards. The event
brought together more than 150
representatives from about 70
airlines for a night of celebration
and appreciation. Twenty-four
awards in six categories were
presented to airlines which made
the most significant contribution to
passenger and airfreight traffic at
Changi Airport in 2022.
CAG remains committed to
fostering deeper engagements with
its trade partners. Changi Travel
Circle 2.0, CAG’s B2B community
platform for its travel trade partners,
was launched with new features.
The enhancements helped to
facilitate more seamless interactions
between members, provided insider
resources that equipped partners
with valuable market insights
and industry updates and gave
partners early access to exclusive
experiences and deals.
Enhancing cargo connectivity
and capacity
In 2023/24, Changi handled
1.8 million tonnes of airfreight
throughput. Based on international
cargo traffic, Changi ranked 12th
globally in 2023 and the busiest in
Southeast Asia.
During the year, Changi welcomed
four new freighter airlines – Air
Incheon, Shandong Airlines Cargo,
Sichuan Airlines Cargo, and
Myanmar National Airlines – to
its growing network. It added
new freighter city links to Haikou,
Nanning, and Yangon. The ongoing
collaboration between DHL Express
and Singapore Airlines deepened
with the successful induction of
all five B777 freighters. These
freighters operate 12 weekly
flights to key destinations such as
Cincinnati, Honolulu, Los Angeles
and Sydney, further augmenting
Changi’s freighter connectivity.
Strengthening air cargo
industry partnerships
Europe was Changi’s second largest
region by air trade in 2022, and
Belgium-Singapore was a key air
trade lane for high-value cargo such
as biopharmaceuticals. In March
2023, CAG signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with Brussels Airport
Company to collaborate on initiatives
to improve pharma air logistics and
share best practices in driving air
cargo operations excellence through
digitalisation and innovations.
CAG is the founding and strategic
member of Pharma.Aero, another
international partnership where it
played an active role in spearheading
projects to improve air pharma
transportation. One notable project
was the Green Air Pharma Logistics,
where Changi and its project
partners developed the building
blocks of a Lane Sustainability
Readiness Index. These collaborative
initiatives showcased Changi’s
commitment towards the pursuit of
greener air logistics.
Changi air cargo hub’s dedication
to excellence was acknowledged
on the international stage through
several awards. These included
World Air Cargo Awards 2023 for
Airport of the Year, the Asian Freight
Logistics & Supply Chain Awards
2023 (AFLAS) for Best Airport – Asia
(over 1 million tonnes), the Air Cargo
News Awards 2023 for Cargo Hub
of the Year, the Payload Asia Awards
2023 for Global Hub of the Year,
and the STAT Trade Times Award
for Excellence in Air Cargo 2023 –
International Cargo Airport of the
Year. The recognitions attested to
Changi’s exceptional network, robust
connectivity, and best-in-class cargo
handling capabilities.

UNVEILING THE WONDER OF
TERMINAL 2 TO THE WORLD
Pushing the boundaries of airport
experience and innovation continues
to be the hallmark of CAG. On 1
November 2023, CAG announced
the full reopening of Terminal 2 (T2)
ahead of schedule after completing
three and a half years of engineering
and expansion works.
T2’s expansion added more
than 21,000 square metres to
the terminal building to support
additional infrastructure, new
systems and expanded retail
options. Its reopening marked
the return of full four-terminal
operations at Changi Airport and
boosted capacity to 90 million
passengers per annum, a timely
move in view of the strong air
traffic recovery.
Fortifying passenger service
Prior to T2’s full reopening, CAG
conducted numerous operational
readiness trials with airport
partners and workers. T2’s
North wing was opened on 28
September 2023, following the
operationalisation of the South
wing in 2022. Test flights were
carried out to ensure airport staff
at all touch points across T2’s
North wing were familiar with the
operations.
CAG worked with nine airlines
– Air Japan, All Nippon Airways,
Ethiopian Airlines, Etihad Airways,
FireFly, IndiGo, Lufthansa,
Singapore Airlines (selected flights)
and SWISS – for a smooth cross-
terminal relocation to T2 North.
Sixteen airlines now operate at T2.
To provide greater convenience
to passengers, T2 reconfigured
its departure hall layout and
nearly doubled the number of
automated check-in kiosks and bag
drop machines in its new central
common-use Fast and Seamless
Travel (FAST) zone. Immigration
halls were also expanded to
accommodate more automated
immigration lanes to facilitate
quicker processing of passengers.
To make the travel journey more
inclusive, T2 rolled out automated
Special Assistance Lanes for
individuals with disabilities and
families with young children
at both arrival and departure
immigration, a first at Changi
Airport.
The baggage claim hall was
enhanced with the extension of
two existing baggage belts to

accommodate higher bag volumes,
particularly from wide-body
aircraft. A state-of-the-art Early
Baggage Storage (EBS) facility was
also built. This fully automated
EBS system increased the storage
capacity of bags from 2,200 to
2,400 bags at any given time. It
is powered by automated cranes
which can store and retrieve
bags in designated storage slots,
greatly reducing manpower needs
while improving efficiency and
productivity.
T2’s critical systems and building
equipment at the end of their
operational lives were also
upgraded to more efficient models.
A new chiller plant was installed
to reduce energy consumption
for cooling by 30%, while still
maintaining passenger comfort.
New magical attractions at T2
As a world-class airport operator,
CAG broke new ground in airport
experience with the T2 expansion
project. T2’s design concept is
heavily inspired by nature. Natural
materials are used in wall cladding
and flooring to create a soothing
ambience. Large green columns
with a myriad of plants traversing
the departure and arrival halls
create a lush garden experience.
At the heart of T2’s departure hall
is one of Changi’s latest landside
attractions, ‘The Wonderfall’. Set
amid a vertical garden, this four-
storey-high digital display features
a majestic waterfall cascading over
megalithic boulders in melodic
rhythms of nature. It is truly a feast
for the senses, transporting visitors
to an immersive world of wonder.
Inside the departure transit hall,
another breathtaking attraction
awaits. A brand-new garden,
‘Dreamscape’, harmoniously
combined digital content,
horticulture and fish in the same
space. With its meticulously
landscaped backdrop, seamlessly
joining a ‘digital sky’ which changes
its hues depending on the time and
weather of the day, travellers are
set to be mesmerised.
The immersive experience continues
at ‘Flap Pix’, an installation which
features the iconic mechanical
split-flap flight information board,
previously used in T2. Using 1,080
split-flaps, visitors can capture
selfies and watch the images come
to life on the board.
A brand-new children’s playground,
‘2 Bears Hideout’, can also be
found in T2’s transit area. Children
can snuggle up in a beehive,
bounce on a honeycomb, or let
their imagination run wild in this
natural play space.
Rejuvenating concession
spaces
New retail offerings with freshly
designed spaces were introduced
at T2 to captivate visitors and
passengers, including 27 new-to-
Changi brands.
The debut of Jones the Grocer,
Changi’s first landside duplex
cafe, brought excitement to the
departure hall. This renowned
artisanal cafe featured a grab-and-
go deli-style food counter on the
ground floor, while the upper level
housed a bar and restaurant with a
scenic view of the departure hall.
Several local homegrown brands,
such as Lynk Fragrances and
Baker’s Well, also made their
debuts in T2. These uniquely
Singaporean brands showcased
Singapore’s rich heritage and
creations to an international
audience.
Diners can enjoy their meals under natural light and flora at the new Gourmet Garden.
Pushing the
boundaries of
airport experience
and innovation
continues to be the
hallmark of CAG.
CHANGI AIRPORT GROUP 27
Other notable F&B brands included
popular ramen chain, Keisuke
Ramen, which set up its outlet for
the very first time in Changi. New-
to-Changi concepts included A-Roy
Thai, JINJJA Kitchen, Kenangan
Coffee, Cafe O, Swensen’s
Unlimited and XW Western Grill,
which provided fresh dining options
such as buffets.
For passengers looking to dine in
natural settings, the new Gourmet
Garden in T2’s transit area offers
a unique experience with an
expansive view of the apron and
verdant foliage cascading overhead.
The dining area showcases
Singapore’s distinctive flavours,
including The Satay Club by Harry’s,
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice, The
Hainan Story Bakery, CRAVE Nasi
Lemak, Old Chang Kee and Hard
Rock Café.
To delight passengers with a
penchant for wines and spirits,
Lotte Duty Free Wines & Spirits
renovated the double-storey
store and infused it with several
new features, including a robot
bartender, Toni. The store features
a unique 30-metre LED ring above
the bar, displaying scenes inspired
by the work of Tang dynasty poet,
Li Bai – ‘Drinking Alone Under
the Moon’. The ‘Forest of Li Bai’
located at Lotte’s upper level
allows passengers to experience 18
whiskey varieties from a dispenser
wall and bask in the vibrant hues of
the LED video ceiling. In addition,
they can also snap selfies with
images of renowned K-pop artists
using an intelligent selfie mirror.
T2 recognised for its
excellence
T2 expansion project won the
Building and Construction
Authority’s (BCA) Universal
Design Excellence Award for its
design and user-friendliness, a
strong recognition to its intuitive
and inclusive design features
that strives to provide comfort
for all passengers and visitors.
Additionally, it was awarded the
BCA Green Mark Platinum for its
sustainability features, attesting
to the highest level of
environmental performance.

UNVEILING THE
WONDER OF TERMINAL 2
TO THE WORLD
ENHANCING THE
CHANGI EXPERIENCE
Amid robust resurgence in travel
in financial year 2023/24, CAG
continued to deliver exceptional
service to its passengers. In
recognition of its relentless
commitment to service excellence,
Changi Airport won four Airport
Service Quality (ASQ) awards from
Airports Council International in
2023. In the Asia-Pacific region,
Changi was named Best Airport
(over 40 million passengers),
Airport with the Most Dedicated
Staff, Easiest Airport Journey, and
Cleanest Airport. These awards
attest to Changi’s dedication
to delivering a top-class airport
experience.
Strengthening partnerships
for smoother journeys
CAG collaborated with the
Immigration & Checkpoints
Authority (ICA) to enhance the
Automated Clearance Initiative.
Automated lane eligibility
was expanded to 60 foreign
nationalities, and 16 more
automated lanes were deployed
across Terminals 1 and 3’s arrival
halls. In August 2023, auto-
clearance for non-biometric
passport holders was also rolled
out. These efforts resulted in
faster immigration clearance and
fewer bottlenecks, with arrival
automated lane usage among
arriving passengers soaring to a high
of 75%.
In preparation for the New
Clearance Concept (NCC), which
will allow departing passengers to
clear immigration using biometric
data without the need to show
their passport, CAG embarked on
an immigration hall revamp across
Terminals 1, 3 and 4 to install ICA’s
new automated gates. The NCC
pilot was launched in Terminal 2
(T2) in April 2024 and will be rolled
out progressively to all terminals
in 2024.
To rebalance traffic demand and
optimise capacity across the four
terminals, CAG conducted multiple
intra-terminal and inter-terminal
airline relocations. A series of tests
and flight trials with airlines such as
Etihad Airways, United Airlines and
Vietnam Airlines was implemented
to ensure a smooth cutover to the
new operating terminals.
Leveraging technology
for efficiency
As a company focused on
innovation, CAG constantly
looks for new ways to make its
operations more efficient. It
introduced autonomous cleaning
robots in Terminals 2 and 4 to
enhance its cleaning processes.
These robots can automatically
follow a programmed path to
effectively sweep and vacuum
assigned locations without the
need for human intervention,
generating up to 30% in manpower
savings. CAG plans to scale up
the deployment of such robots in
Terminals 1 and 3.
As CAG moves towards more
dynamic, time-critical, responsive
and data-driven airport operations,
it also rolled out its new Enterprise
Data Platform Plus (EDP+)
to transform data collection,
processing and analysis from the
traditional post-event mode, to
near real-time. This enables CAG
to achieve a much higher level of
operational excellence in areas
such as situation awareness, real-
time monitoring and alerts, and
systems and service recovery.
The availability of time-critical,
processed data in this new
integrated platform presented new
opportunities for innovations to
enhance manpower productivity
and user experience. As a result
of these achievements, CAG was
named the ‘Team of the Year –

CIO100 Award ceremony held in
October 2023.
Refreshing traveller and
visitor experiences
In 2023/24, CAG continued to
enhance the traveller experience
beyond traditional airport
boundaries. The Free Bicycle Rides
campaign, launched in November
2023, was well-received and saw
nearly 1,500 bookings over a
five-month period. The year-long
campaign offered a free two-hour
bicycle rental service to passengers
with layovers of at least 5.5 hours,
allowing them to explore nearby
attractions such as the Changi
Jurassic Mile and East Coast Park.
For the fourth consecutive year,
CAG hosted the Changi Festive
Village as part of the year-end
festivities to engage airport visitors.
The latest instalment in November
2023 attracted over 350,000
visitors. The departure hall at
Terminal 3 (T3) was transformed
into an insta-worthy Candy
Wonderland, featuring a cupcake
Ferris Wheel, a Christmas bear,
and a gingerbread house. Daily
multisensory snowfalls and live
entertainment delighted visitors
and passengers alike.
Visitors to Candy Carnival were also
treated to over 50 confectionary-
themed game booths and 18
themed rides. Crowd favourites
like the bouncy castle, go-karting
attraction and the snow house made
their return, sweetening visitors’
experiences. The Candy Snow
House provided a sub-zero winter
getaway for visitors, inviting them
to make merry with snow slides,
ice sculptures and sports games.
Carnival goers also filled their bellies
with tasty carnival fare from more
than 10 food trucks and stalls.
A notable addition to 2023’s
festivities was the virtual extension
of the Changi Festive Village on
Roblox. CandyVerse, a replica of
T3’s real-world Candy Wonderland,
delighted ‘airport visitors’ in the
virtual world. Over 384,000 global
participants explored the virtual
land of sweets and competed to win
special edition prizes, including a
1.2-metre-tall toy bear plushie.
Shoppers could also purchase

Throughout the year, CAG created
memorable experiences for visitors
with thematic horticulture displays
during festivals such as Eid al-
Fitr, Lunar New Year, and Mid-
Autumn Festival. The Deepavali
and Christmas displays garnered
social media traction, with over
732,000 and 430,000 engagements
respectively.
Strengthening the ONE
Changi community
CAG continued to strengthen
its partnership with the airport
community. In February
2024, Changi’s Annual Airport
Celebration returned full-scale
for the first time since Covid-19.
The event honoured outstanding
individuals in the airport
community for their exceptional
contributions and unwavering
dedication to deliver the Changi
Experience. Twenty-one awards
were given across five categories.
Transport Minister Chee Hong
Tat graced the ceremony and
presented the top two awards:
Service Personality of the Year
and Service Partner of the
Year. The latter was awarded
to P-Serv for the organisation’s
dedication to cultivating a multi-
skilled workforce, and leveraging
technology to elevate passenger
service standards throughout the
pandemic.
The ONE Gracious & Green Changi
campaign was also launched in
May 2023 to nurture a caring
airport environment and promote
sustainability among staff. Over
800 airport staff attended the
special carnival featuring games
and learning stations. To support
the special needs youth from Metta
Welfare Association, sustainable
products made by them were put
on sale during this special occasion.
Representatives from Smarte Carte,
one of CAG’s ONE Changi partners,
also came onboard as green
ambassadors during the carnival.
CAG constantly seeks new
avenues to make a difference to
the community, with its airport
partners. It hosted the inaugural
Changi Airport Community Charity
Golf event to support the building
of Maitri School, a new Special
Education School for students with
moderate to severe autism. The
event raised S$500,000 with the
overwhelming support of over 70
airport partners, a true testament
to the collective impact the ONE
Changi community can make.

As air traffic continues to grow and
passenger expectations increase,
CAG doubled down on innovation
and investments in technology
to keep safety standards high,
while strengthening its overall
operational resilience.
Safety and security as key
priorities
Safety and security remain
paramount at both Changi and
Seletar airports. To continue
promoting a strong safety culture
within the airport community, CAG
held the 7th
Airport Safety Awards
programme to recognise notable
safety acts and safety innovation.
The programme saw over 600
airport staff being appreciated for
their contributions. It was well-
received by the airport community
because of the strong focus on
safety amid the rapid recovery of air
travel post-Covid.
Compliance with aviation
regulations was another key focus
for CAG throughout the year.
CAG began the renewal process
for the aerodrome certificates of
both Changi and Seletar that takes
place every five years. Guided by
the Aerodrome Recertification
Steering Committee, the team
worked closely with the Civil
Aviation Authority of Singapore
(CAAS) for a series of audits to
be conducted to assess that
regulatory requirements across
documentation, operations,
facilities and infrastructure were
well met, and that CAG’s Safety
Management System was robust.
On 1 December 2023, CAG
successfully reopened Runway
2, which had undergone a
significant improvement, including
the construction of connecting
taxiways. This process was
stringently managed to ensure
that the proceedings were
compliant with strict regulatory
standards. Particular focus was
placed on design and construction
considerations, safety controls, and
system readiness. An upgraded
iFerret 2.0 system, with improved
automated runway surface
Foreign Object Debris detection
capabilities, was also commissioned
as part of the runway’s reopening.
These initiatives improved aviation
safety and operational efficiency at
Changi Airport.
On the security front, CAG
commenced trials for the
Automated Prohibited Items
Detection System (APIDS) to lift
Changi Airport’s security screening
technology to the next level. APIDS
uses artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning to enhance the
speed and accuracy of security
screening for hand-carry baggage.
The system also improves the
speed of security clearance, and
allows for optimised deployment of
manpower resources.
Remaining ever-ready for
emergencies
Being able to respond quickly to
an emergency is key to airport
business continuity at both Changi
and Seletar airports. To this end,
CAG continued to explore new
ways to improve its capabilities
and protocols, and to be ready to
respond to unexpected situations
at a moment’s notice.
During Exercise Bobcat – the
annual full-scale aircraft crash
exercise at Changi Airport – teams
took the opportunity to evaluate
the effectiveness of their crisis
protocols under realistic conditions.
Involving more than 20 agencies
and over 200 role-players, Exercise
Bobcat 2023 marked the first time
where CAG was able to simulate
the actual steps in deploying
field teams from the Immigration
& Checkpoints Authority to
facilitate immigration clearance
of hospitalised passengers and

reuniting these passengers
with their next-of-kin at Changi
General Hospital.
The exercise also served as a
testbed for new technologies that
could better assist the Airport
Emergency Service (AES) Division
in their response efforts. For
example, the CASEVAC (casualty
evacuation) Bot, which can
autonomously convey injured
passengers to a safety zone, was
upgraded to assist firefighters in
the physically demanding work of
laying close to 150 metres of water
lines. The robots free up precious
AES capacity to focus on the
lifesaving rescue efforts, addressing
limitations around manpower
and endurance.
Similar enhancements were
trialled during Seletar Airport’s
full-scale crisis exercise, Exercise
Bear, where uninjured passengers
were processed at a new off-site
location. The reconciliation of these
uninjured passengers with their
loved ones was shortened through
an enhanced online incident
reporting platform, AES E-Net,
that enabled real-time sharing of
information between the Casualty
Clearance Station and the Private
Matching Area. Following the
success of the trial, the full system
was also deployed during Exercise
Bobcat at Changi Airport.
Engineering solutions for
the future
CAG continued to ensure the
resilience of infrastructure and
facilities to future-proof Changi
Airport in anticipation of increasing
travel demand.
Airfield infrastructure expansion
works were completed in the
year in tandem with strong traffic
recovery post-Covid. To handle
growing aircraft movements at
Changi, CAG brought forward the
completion of four new aircraft
parking stands strategically located
in front of Terminal 1 and the
Changi Airfreight Centre. The
completed stands augment Changi’s
capacity to handle layover parking,
cargo operations, and remote
passenger flight operations.
Separately, a project to revitalise
the structural bearings of
four key aircraft and vehicular
bridges across the roads that
lead to Changi Airport was also
undertaken – the first since
Changi started operations in 1981.
Careful planning was required
for this project as the bearing
replacement works had to be
completed during off-peak periods
to minimise disruptions to daily
airport operations and 24/7 traffic
flow along Airport Boulevard.
With the support and input from
multiple stakeholders, works were
successfully completed, extending
the serviceability life span of the
bridges by another three to
four decades.
Besides infrastructure
improvements, innovative
solutions were trialled to improve
productivity. The fully-automated
passenger loading bridge, which
leveraged technology to dock
the aircraft safely at the touch
of a button, would help to free
up airside staff from the current
manual process. It enables airside
staff to focus on other critical
tasks, and deliver faster and
consistent docking operations
through simultaneous automatic
aircraft door detection.
Many underground services, such
as airfield lighting and high-tension
electrical cables, run hundreds of
kilometres under the airfield. To
facilitate upkeeping layout plans
for underground services, CAG’s
Engineering and Development
Cluster created the Augmented
Reality Underground Service
Visualiser (AUSV), a mobile
app that digitally captures and
presents the coordinates and

These in-house innovations were
huge steps towards making the
airfield operations and maintenance
regime future-ready, safer and more
productive.
Over in the public area,
the increased demand for
accommodation at Changi prompted
CAG to explore the idea of
developing a new hotel above the
existing coach stand at Terminal
2 (T2). The hotel would serve the
modern traveller’s market segment
and complement the existing
Crowne Plaza airport hotel facility
located at Terminal 3 (T3) as well
as other parallel developments at
the Changi Precinct. To this end,
a technical feasibility study was
commissioned while CAG’s business
development team simultaneously
assessed the commercial viability
of this project. With these
prerequisites met, CAG launched
the hotel development tender to
invite interested investors, with a
working goal of having the hotel
operationally ready by 2027.
Supporting national initiatives
In line with the national push to
strengthen Singapore’s air border
surveillance of both cargo and air
travellers, Home Team Science and
Technology Agency appointed CAG
as a project manager to construct
a laboratory facility in Changi
Airfreight Centre. The lab allows for
requisite biological and chemical
tests to be carried out on demand,
and is expected to be completed by
the first quarter of 2025.
CAG is also among the pioneer
batch of private entities in the
construction industry to adopt
a collaborative form of contract
for the refurbishment of Express
Courier Centre 2. This collaborative
contract focuses on fairer risk
allocation and helps to foster
a partnership approach with
CAG’s business partners. The
collaborative contracting initiative
also supports Singapore’s Building
and Construction Authority’s
drive to build a more harmonious
work environment in the Built-
Environment sector, which is in line
with CAG’s existing practice.
Seletar Airport
Over at Seletar Airport, the
Single Runway Frequency was
implemented in July 2023 to
improve runway safety. Rigorous
training and tests were conducted
for drivers operating runway
vehicles for a smooth transition to
this new system. Pilots were also
briefed on the updated procedures
to operate under this new
arrangement.
As part of trials to enhance safety
and maintenance efficiency,
Seletar Airport employed tethered
drones to inspect and detect visual
abnormalities on high masts. These
checks were conducted during both
day and night conditions. In addition,
grass cutting robots were deployed
across six areas at the airside, with
accompanying studies on potential
time and manpower savings. To
boost the passenger experience,
the Seletar team also collaborated
with the Shopping Concierge and
iShopChangi teams to launch
e-commerce services.
All in all, these trials reflected Seletar
Airport’s drive to continuously
improve its operational efficiency
and customer satisfaction.
In financial year 2023/24, the
former Seletar Airport Passenger
Terminal Building was reinstated and
refurbished to prepare the facility
to be handed over from CAAS, to
the Singapore Land Authority. As
Singapore’s first civilian airport, a
commemoration event was held in
April 2023 to mark its significance in
Singapore’s aviation history. CAG’s
management, advisors, employees
and Seletar Airport’s partners
gathered for a final visit to this
historic site before its closure to
the public.

TRANSFORMING
AIRPORT OPERATIONS
BUILDING
CHANGI’S FUTURE
In financial year 2023/24,
CAG continued to develop the
Terminal 5 (T5) design and started
preparations for its construction,
which is expected to start in
early 2025. Concurrently, CAG
continued to work on T5’s
dedicated airside road tunnel and
inter-terminal tunnels.
Integrating T5 with existing
terminals
When T5 opens in the mid-2030s,
passengers will be connected to the
other terminals in Changi Airport
and baggage will be transferred
across terminals. To facilitate these
connections, CAG has started the
construction of an annex building
at T2, known as the T2 Connection.
It will house the future interchange
for the baggage handling system,
as well as a station and depot
for the automated people mover
system. The T2 Connection will
also be linked with the inter-
terminal tunnels, ensuring efficient
baggage movement and a seamless
passenger transfer experience
between T5 and other terminals in
the future.
Reopening of Runway 2
Following the closure of Runway
2 in December 2020, CAG carried
out an extensive upgrade to the
existing runway, including the
construction of new taxiways,
improvements to the airfield
lighting control systems, as well
as additional navigational aids.
The drainage system was also
redesigned to cope with climate
change.
In December 2023, Runway 2
reopened, allowing aircraft to
reduce the taxiing distance to
the terminal buildings. When
the 3-runway system becomes
operational, it will significantly
increase Changi Airport’s aircraft
handling capacity.
Transforming future airport
operations
CAG will need robotics and
solutions to automate the handling
processes in airport operations
where possible. In collaboration
with Aurrigo, a leading international
provider of airport transport
technology, CAG has been trialling
the use of the Auto-DollyTug®,
the latest version of its electric-
powered autonomous individual
baggage trailer, at Changi Airport.
Combining the utility of a baggage
tractor and capability of an airport
dolly to carry unit load devices
(ULD), the latest Auto-DollyTug®
can rotate on its own and use its
groundbreaking sideways drive
system to move sideways into
tight spaces. This enables the swift
delivery of a single ULD even with
other ground support equipment
close to the aircraft. This automates
the task of driving baggage
tractors and transporters, aimed
at alleviating manpower shortages
faced by ground handling agents.
Automating airside processes
can also create opportunities to
improve baggage delivery efficiency
and enhance passenger service
levels.
Changi Airport is the first in the world
to test the Auto-DollyTug’s ability to
autonomously load and unload ULDs at the
aircraft stand.

With Changi’s passenger traffic
picking up pace steadily over
the past year, there was an
improvement in retail growth with
concession sales reaching over
S$2 billion in 2023.
Changi’s exciting retail mix also
continued to grow swiftly, with
over 150 leases awarded, including
more than 40 being new-to-Changi
brands in the past financial year.
CAG worked closely with tenants to
bring vibrancy and footfall to Changi
Airport’s shopping and dining
landscape through a curation of
campaigns, activations, new stores
and innovative experiences.
Injecting excitement into the
everyday with airport-wide
initiatives
In June 2023, ‘Be A Changi
Millionaire’ made its long-awaited
return after a three-year hiatus.
For the first time, shoppers did
not have to meet a minimum
spend to take part in this year-
long airport-wide retail campaign.
This broadened participation
and allowed even more shoppers
across Changi Airport, Jewel and
iShopChangi a chance to win daily
instant prizes, such as S$1,000
cash, air tickets and staycations.
Shoppers who spend above S$50
qualify for a chance at S$1 million
in cash or a Porsche Macan in the
Grand Draw event to be held in the
second half of 2024.
From September 2023 to February
2024, the ‘World of Wines and
Spirits (WOWS) returned for its
second edition after a successful
run the year before. The event
boasted a collection of over
100 premium and rare liquor
products from nearly 60 globally
acclaimed brands, available for
purchase on the WOWS online
portal. Both the masterclasses and
VIP event at Capitol Theatre in
October 2023 featured immersive
culinary experiences, with brand
ambassadors sharing exclusive
insights into the appreciation of
spirits and Michelin-starred chefs
uniting their culinary prowess to
specially craft exquisite menus
for attendees.
To grow the in-airport advertising
business, new digital assets were
launched in prominent sites, such
as the high-definition LED displays
in Terminal 2’s (T2) departure hall,
the 360 digital gateway at Terminal
3 (T3), and screens at T2 and T3
Jewel link bridges. These displays
allow advertisers to maximise
brand exposure using high
impact visuals.
The WOWS VIP event in October 2023 was attended by 420 invited guests from Changi

CURATING MAGICAL SHOPPING
AND DINING MOMENTS
Tailoring unforgettable retail
experiences for travellers
Targeted campaigns were tailored
to recapture the interest of Chinese
travellers, especially with the
reopening of China’s borders in early
2023. Campaigns were rolled out
during key travel seasons, including
Lunar New Year and Golden Week,
in partnership with major payment
providers preferred by the Chinese,
resulting in an encouraging uplift in
sales.
Changi 1st
activations continued
to delight travellers with exclusive
launches of the latest limited-
edition products and exceptional
shopping experiences. Over the
past year, there were 15 Changi
1st collaborations with brands like
KILIAN Paris, House of Suntory, and
Jo Malone London, creating overall
increased demand especially in the
liquor and beauty categories.
A myriad of new shops and concepts
have also been introduced in
transit to rejuvenate the passenger
experience, ranging from top luxury
labels like Bulgari, Cartier, Qeelin
and TODS, to beloved lifestyle
brands like LEGO and MLB Korea.
Local offerings also made their
debut to showcase the specialties
of Singapore, including jeweller
Asian Artistry and wellness service
Natureland Spa.
Innovative man-less concepts
continue to debut in the transit
areas, bringing convenience
to passengers, and increasing
manpower productivity. These
include ELLA, a fully automated
robotic barista at T2 and T3, as
well as the AI-powered, unmanned
Hydrate convenience store at T3
which allows customers to purchase
hot drinks, snacks, souvenirs and
more with one tap of their credit
card at the entrance. Like Lotte
Duty Free’s flagship store in T2, the
equally impressive T3 equivalent
also features their state-of-the-art
robotic bartender. Unique to the
T3 store is an interactive sommelier
which helps visitors select the wine
most suited for their palate.
Changi continued to wow customers
beyond Singapore’s shores with
retail innovations such as the
Changi Pay digital wallet’s new
overseas payment feature. Launched
in September 2023, Singapore
residents can now pay like a local at
tens of millions of Alipay merchants.
First rolled out for use in China, it
allows Changi’s customers to take
advantage of the local preference
for QR payments. The service has
since been expanded to other
Asian countries, such as Japan and
Malaysia, and will be expanded to
even more countries in 2024.
Diversifying Changi’s
e-commerce business to
anticipate customer needs
Changi Airport’s e-commerce
platform, iShopChangi, made strides
in growing the business in the last
year, doubling its offered brands
to over 2,000, including more
than 100 off-airport merchants
across categories, such as beauty,
electronics, wellness and more.
Campaigns, such as the inaugural
‘Tax AbsorbMania’, where
participants could exchange the
Goods and Service Tax (GST) in their
receipts for iShopChangi credits,
as well as partnerships with local

To further widen its customer base,
sales channels were expanded to
serve passengers travelling through
Seletar Airport and airlines. A
special partnership with ZIPAIR
made iShopChangi the airline’s
in-flight tax and duty-free sales
retailer, allowing passengers to
make purchases six hours, or earlier,
online or in-air, before their arrival
flight landing time and collect their
purchases upon arrival at Changi
Airport or have purchases
delivered to their residence.
New non-traveller services like on-
demand, same-day delivery and gift-
wrapping were launched to cater
to last-minute and special occasion
needs, offering convenience,
personalisation, and reliability to
customers.
Through iShopChangi, non-airport
retail merchants have also been able
to curate a selection of over 1,000
products to be sold to travellers,
allowing them to successfully
traverse both segments while
providing more variety to travelling
shoppers.
Revitalising public areas to
make Changi a go-to lifestyle
destination
A regular cadence of exciting events
and promotions helped to position
Changi Airport’s public areas as a
must-visit location for local visitors
and travellers.
During the 2023 June school
holidays, CAG collaborated with
Hasbro Gaming to turn T3’s
departure hall into a wonderland
of larger-than-life board games,
such as ‘Monopoly’, ‘Connect
4’, and ‘Game of Life’. A ‘Hungry
Hungry Hippos’-themed inflatable
playground, photo spots, and
exclusive premiums also added to
the fun. Similarly, the 2024 March
school holiday’s ‘Explore and Play
at Changi’ enticed visitors to T3
with a whimsical tropical forest
playground and playful otter-
themed photo spots.
A plethora of shopping and dining
campaigns keep Changi’s landside
constantly abuzz with activity.
‘Feast at Changi’ coincided with the
opening of new dining options at
T2, incentivising visitors to spend
S$60 via Mastercard on Changi Pay
at Changi’s F&B outlets to receive a
S$10 Changi Pay return e-voucher.
The highly anticipated ‘2XGST’
campaign made its return in August
2023 and again in January 2024,
providing shoppers some reprieve
from the hike in GST. On top of
GST-absorbed prices, Changi
Rewards members also enjoyed an
additional 9% off their purchases
with a minimum spend. For the
2024 Lunar New Year celebrations,
Changi introduced more retail
excitement with its red packet gift-
with-purchase promotion, festive
feasting campaign and two-hour
free parking promotions.
ST3PS, T3’s public auditorium, was
a hive of activity over the course
of the year. Daily movie screenings
and live football matches kept
both first-time visitors and regulars
coming back for more. Weekly yoga
lessons, exhibitions, National Day
and Christmas celebrations add
life to the space, also bringing in
footfall to the surrounding shops.
To meet the varied needs of Changi’s
visitors and travellers, the JustCo
co-working space was opened at
T3 in October 2023. As Asia’s first
pay-per-minute co-working centre
in an airport with traveller-friendly
amenities, the space includes a
mixture of 70 private offices, 45
pay-per-use workstations, an event
space and napping pods. To date, all
private offices have been leased out,
and the meeting rooms and event
spaces also serve as alternative
venues for airport staff to host
corporate activities.
The highly anticipated ‘2XGST’ campaign allows Changi Rewards members to enjoy additional
discounts on top of tax-absorbed purchases with a minimum spend.

CURATING MAGICAL
SHOPPING AND
DINING MOMENTS
In financial year 2023/24, CAG
launched several initiatives to
personalise and enhance different
digital journeys for customers.
These initiatives underscore
CAG’s commitment to delivering
exceptional customer experiences,
enriching engagements, and
setting new benchmarks in digital
innovation on the world stage.
App-solutely magical: Changi
App upgrade takes flight
The Changi App went through
a milestone transformation,
reflecting its pivotal role in CAG’s
digital ecosystem. CAG introduced
a new brand interface, enhancing
the app’s user-friendliness and
making it even easier to navigate.
This upgrade enables customers
to use the app more seamlessly for
travel, shopping and dining.
Previously known as iChangi, the
revamped app offers customers
a host of new and enhanced
features to provide a seamless
and stress-free journey through
Changi Airport. For example, when
customers save their flight details
on the app, they now receive
personalised travel information,
recommendations for relevant
facilities and services, travel
checklists, advisories and helpful
push notifications on their flight
and baggage status.
To encourage even more travellers
to explore this new feature,
CAG launched a 12-month
campaign, ‘The Great Changi
Appscapade’, in November 2023.
Customers who save their flights
using the Changi App stand a
chance to win four business class
tickets to a destination revealed
at the start of each month, along
with instant-win prizes such as
Changi Rewards points and Changi
Pay vouchers.
Changi App users are also able
to make restaurant reservations
at participating venues across
Changi Airport’s terminals and
Jewel. They can also pre-book
tickets to various airport events
and attractions, as well as redeem
benefits with Changi Rewards
points earned from spending
across the terminals, Jewel and
iShopChangi.
Following the upgrade, the app’s
monthly active user base increased
by nearly 30%. Leveraging modern
modular technical architecture,
the app’s new build will enable
CAG to scale the app, and drive
productivity and efficiency by
delivering more features and
updates faster and more flexibly.
The revamped Changi App seeks to deliver the magic of Changi to customers’ fingertips.

Personalised communications
with My Travel Journey
CAG enhanced its ‘My Travel
Journey’ programme with the
vision of providing personalised
information to customers who
would be travelling soon, to
help them in their journey to
and through Changi Airport. The
programme was the outcome of a
strategic review of Changi Airport’s
customer engagement journey
that involved 14 cross-functional
teams within the organisation.
The goal was to unify individual
digital touchpoints to create a more
cohesive and holistic experience for
our customers.
The results were positive, with
the net promoter score for the
programme showing a 17%
improvement from the previous
year. Looking ahead, there are plans
to expand the programme to cover
non-travel customer journeys, and
to use marketing technology to
drive more personalisation based
on customers’ preferences and their
interactions with Changi Airport.
Reinventing the
Changi Experience
To enhance engagement with its
customers and strengthen Changi
Airport’s position as more than
a transport node, CAG launched
ChangiVerse on Roblox, becoming
one of the first airports to officially
launch a virtual world on the
platform. Developed in partnership
with Accenture, ChangiVerse
revolutionised the online airport
experience by giving fans of
Changi, or those who have not had
the chance to travel through the
airport, the opportunity to explore,
interact, and engage with Changi
Airport in the digital space.
ChangiVerse complements the
on-ground experience at Changi
Airport by playfully reimagining
notable sights such as the Changi
control tower, Terminals 2 and 3,
Jewel, Jurassic Mile, among others.
The virtual world also features
mini-games that simulate airport
experiences like flight check-in
and baggage claim, with players
accumulating experience points
to level up and gain access to
exclusive items or areas. Anchor
games such as the Changi Kart
racing game and Gardentopia
gardening game were also
designed to put a whimsical twist
on the Changi Experience. Other
activities players can enjoy include
bouncing on clouds, customising
planes, chilling in glamping tents
that celebrate festive seasons, or
relaxing a bustling café.
Since its launch, ChangiVerse
has seen more than nine million
visits and over three million digital
wearable redemptions.
Transforming search:
enabling a seamless and
efficient digital experience
Customers experienced a
smoother and more efficient
search function on the Changi
App over the past year. The
implementation of a unified
search engine in February 2024
ensured consistent, reliable and
relevant search results. Similar
enhancements for changiairport.com
are planned for the coming year.
This effort set the groundwork
for further improvements, with
the second phase focusing on AI-
powered algorithms to drive search
capabilities as Generative AI and
chat capabilities are concurrently
explored. These enhancements
aim to provide customers with
an intuitive and precise search
experience across these key digital
platforms.
Working through challenges such
as evolving user search behaviours
and the need for ongoing algorithm
optimisation, CAG aims to provide
customers with a consistent,
flexible, and user-friendly search
experience, allowing customers
to find easily find the information
that they seek.

BRINGING CHANGI’S
EXPERTISE OVERSEAS
CAG continued to captivate social
media users worldwide with
engaging and diverse content on
Changi Airport. It connected with
960 million users on social media
throughout the year, solidifying
Changi as the world’s most
followed airport and a global brand
synonymous with exceptional
service and a gateway to endless
possibilities.
Igniting excitement for the
rejuvenated Terminal 2
CAG got the world talking
on social media with the full
reopening of Terminal 2 (T2).
The use of visual storytelling and
dynamic content showcased T2 as
a unique destination. Mentions of
T2 soared by 400% in the opening
month of November. Organic
content reached 15.6 million users,
with over 875,000 engagements.
Visuals of ‘The Wonderfall’ were
a hit, gathering 4 million organic
views on Instagram and TikTok.
The fascinating journey of
revitalising T2, showcased in a
three-part series, ‘Transforming
Terminal 2: Behind the Scenes’,
was also published on Facebook
and YouTube. The series racked
up nearly half a million views
alongside positive audience
comments. Its success led to
Singapore Airlines picking it
up as content for their in-flight
entertainment system.
Taking flight on Changi
Airport’s social media
CAG’s social media channels,
namely Facebook, Instagram,
LinkedIn, Telegram, TikTok, X
(previously known as Twitter),
YouTube as well as WeChat, Weibo
and Xiaohongshu (also known
as Red), continued to serve as
important platforms to grow brand
love and sustain interest in Changi’s
offerings.
Creative social media content
garnered over 30 mainstream and
online media pick-ups. This included
unique aircraft liveries like Finnair’s
Moomin characters and Korean
Air’s K-pop-inspired Blackpink
design. With a strong curation
strategy, CAG’s social channels
gained influence, hitting over a
million organic views on YouTube
and surpassing 400,000 Instagram
followers.
Leveraging megatrends to
connect with fans
American singer-songwriter Taylor
Swift’s concerts in Singapore
sparked a regional craze, prompting
CAG to engage fans on social
media. A user-generated campaign
was launched to invite Taylor
Swift to #SeeTheNewForest in
Jewel’s Forest Valley. The campaign
culminated in the ‘beJEWELed’
sing-along event in Jewel.
Alongside local and international
media coverage, the event garnered
37,000 social media mentions and
a reach of over 825 million in the
region. Over a thousand ‘Swifties’
attended, making it Jewel’s largest
sing-along event yet.
Reaching travellers in key
markets
CAG expanded its reach to strategic
markets including Australia, China,
India and Indonesia through
targeted social media content
and innovative campaigns in
collaboration with travel and
airline partners. The Changi
story was brought to life through
engaging activations, interesting
documentaries, and interactive live-
streaming events with influencers.
CAG’s activities in these key
markets reached over 320 million
users, more than double the
number compared to the previous
year.
In anticipation of China’s reopening
in March 2023, CAG launched a
series of campaigns to help Chinese
tourists travel better. WeChat
became the main hub for travellers
from China to access important
information, discover shopping and
entertainment options, and redeem
promotions at Changi. The success
of CAG’s WeChat strategy led to its
recognition as the WeChat Users’
Favourite WeChat Ecosystem at
the Tencent Global Annual Sharing
event in 2023.
CAG’s China Recovery Campaign, which
included a curation of guides on Red to
assist travellers, achieved almost 600,000
engagements in China.

ENGAGING A
GLOBAL AUDIENCE
At the heart of CAG is its biggest
asset – its people. During the year,
CAG strengthened its innovation
culture and equipped employees
with new skills to reimagine the
future of aviation. It also refreshed
its employer brand and fortified the
employee experience to attract and
retain talents.
Nurturing a culture of
innovation
To nurture a culture of innovation,
CAG continued to ride on the
momentum created by the launch
of the ‘4D+i’ initiative in January
2023. The ‘i’ refers to Innovation
Fridays which are dedicated days for
employees to take part in activities
that unlock new skills and explore
new products, while ‘4D’ refers
to streamlining regular work into
four days. Results from an internal
survey conducted in January 2024
were encouraging. Three in five
employees pointed out that they
could commit at least one-fifth of
their time to innovate. At the same
time, two in three employees viewed
setbacks and failures positively as
learning opportunities. Brown bags,
experiential tours and activities
organised on i-Fridays were also
highly rated by employees as an
effective way to learn about CAG’s
innovation ambition.
To unlock bandwidth, CAG also
reviewed work processes and
explored productivity tools, such as
chatbots, to simplify work and give
employees more time for innovation.
It proactively scanned the market
for new technologies, such as
Generative AI, and trained employees
to use these transformative tools to
discover new ways of working and
service delivery.
To enhance the skills and
knowledge of CAG employees for
the future, CAG’s People Team
partnered with dedicated in-house
Centres of Excellence to curate
structured learning pathways
towards three skill pillars – Data/
Digital, Innovation and Leadership,
which are core to CAG’s business
aspirations. It nurtured a growth
mindset among employees with a
refreshed Growth Friend Network,
which saw handpicked employees
actively championing the spirit of
exploration and learning within
their departments.

ATTRACTING AND
BUILDING TALENT
Building a magical
employer brand
To attract the best and brightest
talents to the company, CAG
unveiled a new face to its employer
brand during the year. With the
tagline ‘Come Make MAGIC with
Us’, CAG invited prospective hires
to transform its airport business
through innovation and create
a magical experience for its
customers together.
CAG launched a series of videos
with this campaign to highlight the
strong spirit of collaboration and
innovation. Playing on the anagram
of ‘MAGIC’ to form the #IMCAG
(‘I AM CAG’) identity, the videos
demonstrated how innovation is
embodied by CAG’s employees,
alongside new technologies being
rolled out across the airport, all of
which come together to create the
iconic, magical Changi Experience
for passengers and visitors. The
video series was launched on CAG’s
14th
anniversary in July 2023 across
platforms such as LinkedIn and
YouTube. They were well-received by
employees and the public, resulting
in more than 9,000 page views on
CAG’s corporate career page and an
increase in job applications.
Valuing the employee
experience
During the year, CAG continued
with a hybrid work arrangement
to provide flexibility for its
employees. Employee events, like
wellness activities and celebrations,
were held regularly to provide
opportunities for colleagues to have
fun and bond. These events served
as invaluable platforms to promote
employee well-being.
CAG’s People Team also set up
a new Employee Experience
programme management office
to focus on the important task of
transforming the CAG employee
experience. Several teams were
set up, including one to create the
‘Magic of Onboarding’ for new hires.
Key changes, such as improved
preboarding processes and a
revamped orientation programme,
were implemented, ultimately
leading to significantly increased
satisfaction scores from new hires.
CAG as an employer of choice
CAG’s longstanding reputation of
being an employer of choice was
reflected through strong showings at
HR awards throughout the year. For
the 11th
year in a row, CAG claimed
one of the top spots in the Randstad
Employer Brand Awards, coming in
third in the overall list of the Most
Attractive Employers in Singapore
for 2023. This was accompanied by
a double win in the Singapore’s 100
(S100) Leading Graduate Employers
ranking, as CAG secured top spots
in both the Aviation, Transport
& Supply Chain and Hospitality,
Leisure & Tourism categories for the
second year in a row.
CAG also clinched two golds and a
silver at the HR Excellence Awards
2023, demonstrating its excellence
across Employee Branding,
Recovery & Rebound Strategy, and
HR Innovation domains. It also
received the Fair and Progressive
Employment Practices award at the
Tripartite Alliance Awards 2023, in
recognition of its efforts in building
an effective workplace and inclusive
people practices.
Giving back to society
CAG employees continued to
actively volunteer for charitable
and social causes, with volunteers
clocking over 3,700 hours of their
time in the year. Through the
company’s charitable arm, Changi
Foundation, CAG maintained
its long-term partnership with
NorthLight School, Metta School
and Arts@Metta. The annual CAG
Art Fair returned for its third year,
welcoming participants from
three additional special needs
communities. More than S$16,000
was raised through the month-
long sale of artworks, with all
proceeds going to the participating
beneficiaries.
CAG’s efforts were further
bolstered by airport partners who
supported multiple initiatives
around career awareness and work
exposure for youths. To date, two
youths with special needs have
been hired into jobs based at
Changi Airport. CAG continued to
support their assimilation into the
work environment.
CAG regularly organises employee wellness events aimed at supporting physical, mental and
financial health under its Healthy Habits, Happy Life initiative.

CAG’s commitment to environmental sustainability is centred
across six environmental pillars, which guide its efforts to
reduce carbon emissions, manage waste effectively, conserve
water, adapt its airport operations to climate change,
implement sustainable processes, and adhere strictly to
environmental regulations. Each pillar represents a specific
area of focus, reflecting its comprehensive approach to tackle
environmental challenges.
CAG’s environmental efforts are supported by a governance
framework that promotes accountability, transparency,
and continual improvement. An Environmental Steering
Committee, led by CAG’s senior leaders, sets the
organisation’s environmental goals, tracks progress, and aligns
its efforts with sustainability benchmarks. Specialised working
groups such as the Climate Working Group coordinate
actions across internal and external stakeholders on matters
such as mitigating climate change impact, reducing emissions,
and enhancing resilience against environmental risks.

ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL
SUSTAINABILITY
Aligning carbon reduction
efforts with aviation sector
targets
CAG is committed to growing
its business in a responsible and
sustainable manner. This year, CAG
raised its carbon emissions target
from “Zero Carbon Growth” to a
20% reduction in Scope 1 and 2
emissions by 2030, against a 2019
baseline. This is in line with the
target set by the Civil Aviation
Authority of Singapore (CAAS)
for domestic aviation emissions
under the Singapore Sustainable
Air Hub Blueprint. CAG will achieve
this reduction in absolute carbon
emissions even as Changi Airport
continues to serve more passengers
every year. To achieve this medium-
term target, CAG will raise building
energy efficiency and increase its
adoption of renewable energy.
In the longer term, CAG strives
towards Net Zero by 2050,
enabled by advancements in
technologies for energy efficiency
in buildings, availability of off-site
renewable energy and national grid
decarbonisation.
Beyond its terminal buildings, CAG
works with airport partners to
reduce Changi Airport’s Scope 3
emissions. Plans are underway to
expand CAG’s network of electric
vehicle chargers to support the
airport community’s target of
transitioning all airside vehicles to
cleaner energy vehicles by 2040.
The Singapore Government has
also announced the introduction
of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)
levy from 2026 onwards, which
aims to accelerate SAF adoption
at Changi Airport. The SAF levy
will be based on a 1% target for a
start, with a forward-looking goal of
raising it to 3-5% by 2050, subject
to global development and the
wider availability and adoption
of SAF.
Home to Singapore’s largest
single-site rooftop solar PV
system
Expanding on-site renewable
energy deployment
In January 2024, CAG commenced
the installation of a large-scale solar
photovoltaic (PV) system on the
rooftop areas of Changi Airport,
encompassing its passenger and
cargo terminal buildings as well
as auxiliary structures. When
completed in 2025, this system
will have an installed capacity of
38 megawatt-peak (MWp) and will
be Singapore’s largest single-site
rooftop solar PV system.
This project marks an important
milestone in Changi Airport’s de-
carbonisation journey – the new
solar PV system is expected to
reduce annual carbon emissions by
nearly 20,000 tonnes per annum, or
about 10% of CAG’s carbon footprint
in 2018/19. This is equivalent to the
energy required to power 10,000
four-room HDB residential flats in
Singapore each year.
Deploying solar PV systems at
airports present unique challenges
as compared to conventional
installations at commercial, industrial,
or residential sites. For example,
robust simulations have to be
carried out to ensure that the solar
panels do not pose glare and glint
effects to the air traffic control
tower and pilots, nor interfere
with signals from communications,
navigation & surveillance (CNS) and
meteorological facilities. In addition,
the installation and operation of
solar PV systems must comply with
international aviation safety and
security requirements, including
higher fire safety precautions, beyond
those required under the Singapore
Civil Defence Force’s Fire Code.
Pursuing new innovations
Given inherent space constraints
at Changi Airport, CAG is pushing

ACTION
the envelope beyond conventional
rooftop areas to meet longer-term
decarbonisation goals.
Part of the project will also explore
installing a ground-mounted solar
PV system at a grass turf within
Changi Airport’s airfield. This will
be the first time in Singapore that
a solar PV system is installed in
the airfield - demonstrating CAG’s
commitment towards realising
Changi Airport’s full solar potential.
Looking ahead, CAG and CAAS
will be carrying out a joint study
to assess the technical and
commercial viability of installing
solar PV systems at more areas
of the airfield. An early estimate
suggests that wider deployment
of solar installations on the airfield
could enable CAG to reduce
its absolute carbon emissions
by a further 5%. Through this
study, CAG hopes to unlock
greater on-site renewable energy
potential, without compromising
International Civil Aviation
Organisation (ICAO) and local
requirements for safety and
efficiency of airport operations.
The study will examine critical
factors such as the risks of visual
disturbance to pilots and air
traffic controllers, radar signal
interference, foreign object
hazards, as well as potential impact
on aircraft rescue and firefighting
emergency response. The study will
also explore innovative engineering
solutioning to overcome height
restrictions at sensitive areas of
the airfield, such as the non-graded
areas of runway and taxiway strips.
The study is expected to complete
in mid-2025.
Electricity consumption
CAG’s electricity consumption
constitutes 99.5% of CAG’s Scope
1 and 2 emissions. In 2023/24,
CAG consumed 389,000 megawatt
CAG and CAAS will
be carrying out a
joint study to assess
the technical and
commercial viability
of installing solar
PV systems at more
areas of the airfield.

Changi carbon offsets
Singapore’s aviation sector has been adopting technological
advancements and implementing new policies to accelerate
the transformation to sustainable air travel. These efforts
include:
• Aircraft manufacturers improving aircraft fuel efficiency.
• Changi Airport, airlines and ground handlers optimising
aircraft taxiing times, reducing taxi fuel burn.
• Progressive adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.
As the aviation industry works together for greener travel,
travellers also have avenues to offset their air travel carbon
emissions.
Changi Carbon Offsets was launched in November 2023
to give passengers a convenient means to offset air travel
emissions. The public can access the Changi carbon calculator
through the Changi Airport website, Changi App and Changi
Wi-Fi landing page to calculate the carbon emissions from
their upcoming flights based on the origin, destination and
class of travel.
CAG has selected high-quality carbon offset projects, which
have beneficial impacts on the environment and communities.
CAG has also fully offset flight emissions from staff corporate
travel since the launch of Changi Carbon Offsets.
Enhance awareness on the
importance of prevention and
management of heat-related
illnesses.
Collaboration with airside
partners to supply protective
sun wear and adopt heat
acclimatisation protocols, such
as the flexibility to have more
rest breaks during high heat
stress days.
Partnership with Raffles Medical
Group to facilitate seminars
aimed at educating airside
supervisors on recognising
symptoms of heat stroke and
administering first aid for
heat stress.
The airside community also
set up a working group to
incorporate heat management
protocols into work processes
and heat acclimatisation
programmes for new joiners.

Waste management
CAG manages material resources,
invests in efficient waste
technologies, and partners airport
stakeholders to both avoid waste
generation and recycle more
effectively. This minimises waste
sent to Singapore’s incineration
plants and improves recycling rates.
In 2023, CAG established a
comprehensive waste baseline to
monitor and measure its waste
management initiatives effectively.
Waste generated and recycled
at external buildings and sites
managed by CAG, including the
Changi Airfreight Centre and the
plant nursery were measured,
which contributed to an increased
recycling rate in 2023/24.
To enhance understanding of
recycling potential within passenger
terminal buildings, CAG completed
a waste assessment study to
collect and analyse the various
types of waste being disposed. In
collaboration with airport tenants
and with support from a local waste
recycling company, CAG identified
key challenges and opportunities
in waste reduction and recycling
processes. These insights will
support ongoing efforts to develop
a robust waste management
strategy and set long-term targets.
Self-service waste sortation
To promote waste segregation and
recycling, CAG designed a sortation
bin that was implemented at the
tray and crockery return stations
across the airport.
These tray return stations feature
recycling graphics and signages to
guide users on proper recycling
practices and reduce cross-
contamination. Users can self-
sort their waste into five waste
streams: liquid waste, food waste,
plastic bottles, metal cans and non-
recyclables. Since the installation
of the first system at Terminal 1 in
January 2024, an average of 90kg
of recyclables has been collected
each month. This initiative has also
resulted in the on-site treatment
of 600kg of food waste per month.
There are plans to expand this
system airport-wide to encourage
airport employees and passengers
to participate in recycling efforts.
Circularity at the workplace
CAG collaborated with the office
coffee kiosk partner to transition
towards zero-waste. Employees
are encouraged to bring their own
cups instead of using single-use
disposable cups, and all used milk
cartons are recycled.
Used coffee grounds at the kiosk
are sent to CAG’s horticulture
plant nursery to be converted to
compost. The compost is then
used to grow the plants around
the airport. Every month, up
to 80kg of coffee grounds are
recycled through this arrangement.

Changi Airport’s first Sustainability Recycling
Corner was launched in February 2024,
featuring information on the importance of
recycling and how different materials can be
recycled. The installation was curated
to be dynamic, timeless and interactive
with a gamification function to engage
users in learning what it means to practice
responsible recycling.
In collaboration with local and international
partners, including SGRecycle, ALBA and
TOMRA, airport visitors are able to recycle up
to four waste types–e-waste, paper, plastic
bottles and metal cans–within a single location.
The Sustainability Recycling Corner tracks
the number of games played to monitor user
uptake and effectiveness of the initiative.
Every month, an average of 1,000 beverage
containers, 300kg of paper and 100kg of
electronic waste is recycled. Through regular
education and engagement, CAG aims to
foster a culture of sustainability across the
airport community.

chemical treatment methods are
effective in maintaining water
cleanliness, they necessitate
regular dilution and disposal to
manage chemical concentration,
often resulting in significant
water wastage.
In pursuit of a more sustainable
alternative, the Terminal 4 (T4)
integrated Facilities Management
(iFM) team embraced an innovative
treatment system which utilises
ElectroChemical Activation
(ECA). This advanced technology
mirrors the beneficial effects of
traditional treatment, but in an
eco-friendlier manner. It functions
by producing oxidising chemicals
through the electrolysis of water,
effectively managing water quality
and controlling bacteria and other
contaminants without the use
of harsh chemicals. Additionally,
the system incorporates an
electrolytic water softening
process that extracts calcium and
magnesium ions from the water.
This reduces the need for dilution
and disposal to manage chemical
concentration, thereby avoiding
excessive water usage.
A crucial benefit of this system
is its impact on cycles of
concentration (COC) — a measure
that indicates how many times
water can be re-used before
it needs to be replaced. By
enhancing the COC, the system
reduces the frequency of water
flush-outs, enabling the cooling
tower to operate more efficiently
and use less water. This water
management approach has led
to estimated annual water
savings of S$70,000 and a 16%
reduction in cooling tower water
consumption in T4.
By implementing the ECA system,
CAG has enhanced operational
efficiencies and reduced
environmental impact, aligning
with its sustainability goals.
Importantly, these advancements
have been achieved while fully
complying with regulatory water
quality standards, ensuring that
its operations remain sustainable
and compliant.

water management
approach at
Terminal 4 has led

annual savings of

consumption.

CAG employs a life-cycle
perspective in its procurement
decision-making, prioritising
environmental stewardship in
the initial design phase through
to downstream processes to
avoid environmental impact.
This commitment to sustainable
procurement has been integrated
into CAG’s procurement systems
and practices.
In 2022, CAG mandated
a minimum environment
weightage in the evaluation of
new procurements for selected
procurement categories. In 2023,
CAG expanded this environment
evaluation criteria to all
procurement categories.
All bidders of new CAG
procurements will need to:
• demonstrate how their
product or service fulfils the
environment evaluation criteria
that the CAG project team
specifies for each procurement,
and
• meet a minimum environment
score to be awarded the
project.
The Price:Quality:Environment
evaluation framework, along
with the requisite minimum
environmental score for suppliers,
enables CAG to assess and show
preference for suppliers who
are environmentally responsible
and can join CAG in achieving its
environmental goals. In increasing
the demand for sustainable
products and services, CAG
is working with our internal
and external stakeholders to
decarbonise and increase the
sustainability of its supply chain.
For new
procurements,
suppliers will need
to show how they
have fulfilled the
environmental
criteria.

SUSTAINABLE
PROCUREMENT
CAG initiated the “ONE Gracious
and Green Changi” campaign aimed
at cultivating a more caring and
positive airport environment and
inculcating a sustainability mindset
in airport staff. The campaign was
launched successfully through a
carnival held in May 2023 where
participants engaged in various
games and interactive learning
stations, one of which featured
the Reverse Vending Machine by
TOMRA, a recycling initiative
by the Facilities Management Team.
Metta Welfare Association also
came on board to sell sustainable
products that were lovingly crafted
by special needs youths, receiving
a positive response from the
airport community.
Continuing the momentum, the
ONE Changi Learning Fiesta in
August and September 2023
drew over 450 attendees, offering
workshops, exploratory journeys,
and a carnival, themed around
Service Excellence, Sustainability,
and Innovation.
The Sustainable September
campaign, specifically tailored
for CAG employees, delved into
vital environmental stewardship
themes through a series of lunch
time talks and covered topics such
as reducing carbon emissions,
sustainable events planning, green
procurement, and optimising
waste management. In conjunction
with the campaign, like-minded
colleagues came together to
conceptualise and run a ‘Swap-
tacular September Event’, where
employees could donate and
swap their children’s pre-loved
items. It aimed to raise awareness
and encourage employees to
take action in reducing their
environmental footprint, and to
instil a renewed purpose for pre-
loved children’s clothes and books.
The event led to the collection
of up to 26kg of clothes and
425 books, which were donated
to Metta Welfare Association
in support of their community
programmes and the National
Library Board, in support of their
book exchange programmes.
CAG cultivates
a sustainable
workplace by actively
engaging staff in
environmental
stewardship and
community support.

MANAGEMENT
TEAM
(As at 30 June 2024)
The Board and Management of CAG (the “Company”
and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) are
deeply committed to our Company’s core value –
integrity – which is at the heart of everything we do.
We strive to meet and maintain the highest standards
of corporate governance, professionalism and integrity,
to build a company our stakeholders can be proud of.
To operate a sustainable business over the long term
and to uphold and protect the Company’s brand and
reputation, we strongly believe in being accountable to
our immediate business and regulatory environment, as
well as to the global community.
The Company’s Code of Conduct sets out the
principles and standards of conduct that it expects of
all employees in their day-to-day activities and in the
decisions they make. The Company also promotes a
‘speak up’ culture through its whistle blowing policy,
which is intended to detect and deter unethical or
illegal conduct, while protecting whistleblowers from
retaliation.
In 2023, the Company passed the annual surveillance
audit to maintain the ISO 37001 certification for its
anti-bribery management system, providing continuing
assurance to its stakeholders that it maintains
internationally recognised anti-bribery controls and
practices.
In April 2023, the Company was also awarded the
Data Protection Trustmark (DPTM) certification by
the Infocomm Media Development Authority. The
DPTM is a voluntary enterprise-wide certification
for organisations to demonstrate accountable data
protection practices. This is part of the Company’s
efforts to increase its competitive advantage and build
trust with its customers, partners, and stakeholders.
The Board of Directors

Accountability and Audit
Accountability
1. Management provides all members of the Board
with reports on operating and financial information
and key performance indicators on a quarterly basis
and as the Board may require from time to time, to
enable the Board to make balanced and informed
assessments of the Group’s performance, position
and prospects.
Audit Matters
2. The AC comprises the following Directors:
i. Mrs Chng Sok Hui – Chairman
ii. Mrs Tan Ching Yee
iii. BG Kelvin Fan (stepped down on 21 March
2024)
3. The main responsibilities of the AC are to assist
the Board in discharging its statutory and other
responsibilities relating to the Company’s internal
controls, financial and accounting matters,
compliance, and business and financial risk
management.
4. The AC is responsible for reviewing the
effectiveness of financial, compliance and
risk management frameworks, as well as the
robustness of the reporting and disclosure
processes. The AC also reviews the adequacy of
whistleblowing arrangements implemented by
the Company through which employees, partners,
suppliers, contractors, and other stakeholders
can raise concerns in confidence about possible
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or
other matters. All whistle blowing complaints are
reviewed by the AC to ensure independent and
thorough investigation, and adequate follow-up
and resolution of the matters reported. The AC
also provides oversight for the effectiveness of the
Company’s anti-bribery management system.
5. The AC performs independent review of the
financial statements of the Company and reviews
the key areas of management judgment applied for
adequate disclosure, critical accounting policies
and any significant changes that would have a
material impact on the financial statements.
6. The AC reviews the adequacy and effectiveness
of the internal audit function and its processes, as
well as ensures it is adequately resourced to carry
out its function effectively. The AC reviews the
Internal Audit (IA) Division’s plans, its effectiveness
and audit scope, and also approves its budget. The
AC receives reports from IA at the completion of
each audit, and at each AC meeting, IA provides
the AC with updates on the key findings from the
audit reviews, the remediation actions which have
been or will be taken to address these findings,
and an overview of the resolution of the audit
issues (including current and past-due issues) to
verify the effectiveness and timeliness of actions
taken by Management on the internal auditors’
recommendations and observations. Any changes
to the audit plan will also be tabled for AC approval
at the AC meetings.
7. The AC reviews and approves the external audit
plan, the scope and results of the external audit.
The AC also reviews the external audit reports to
ensure that significant findings and observations
regarding control weaknesses are promptly
rectified. Prior to making recommendations to
the Board on the external auditor’s appointment
or reappointment, the AC reviews the external
auditor’s independence, objectivity and quality
of work based on the Audit Quality Indicators
Disclosure framework established by the
Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. In
line with best practice, the external audit partner
is rotated every five years. The AC also reviews the
non-audit fees awarded to the external auditors
to ensure that the non-audit services performed
by them would not affect their independence. The
aggregate amount of audit and non-audit fees
paid for the external auditor of the Company and
its network firms for the financial year ended 31
March 2024 (rounded to the nearest million) was
$0.6m and $0.1m respectively.
8. The AC meets with the internal and/or external
auditors three times during the year. At least one of
these meetings is conducted without the presence
of Management, where the auditors may raise
issues encountered in the course of their work
directly to the AC.

GOVERNANCE
Internal Controls
1. The Board and Management of the Company are
fully committed to maintaining a robust system of
internal controls, procedures and risk management
to safeguard our shareholder’s interests and the
Group’s assets. The Board delegates its oversight
responsibilities for internal controls, financial
and strategic (business) risk management and
compliance matters to the AC, which ensures the
effectiveness and adequacy of the system of internal
controls in the Company, while the ORSC assists the
Board in reviewing the operational and safety risk
management and compliance systems put in place
by Management.
2. The internal controls established by the Company
are supported by systems, processes and people.
The Company’s three lines of defence for risk
management are as follows:
i. the first line of defence is the business units who
are responsible for identifying and managing
risks inherent in their businesses;
ii. the second line of defence comprises the
oversight and control functions such as
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Legal
& Compliance, Aerodrome Safety, Aviation
Security, Cybersecurity & Digital Governance,
and Enterprise Performance; and
iii. the third line of defence is IA, which provides
an independent assessment and assurance on
the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of
the Company’s system of internal controls, risk
management procedures, governance framework
and processes.
3. The Company’s internal and external auditors review
its key internal controls for material non-compliance
or failures in internal controls and recommend areas
of improvements. The AC reviews the effectiveness
of the actions taken by Management in response to
the recommendations made.
4. The AC also reviews the effectiveness of the
enterprise risk management framework and the
risk management processes put in place to manage
financial and strategic (business) risks while meeting
business objectives. Control self-assessments in key
areas of the Group’s businesses / operations are
conducted by Management on a periodic basis to
evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk
management and internal control systems.
5. As part of the Company’s anti-bribery management
system, all employees undergo annual anti-bribery
training, and divisions perform identification and
assessment of bribery risk annually and put in
place appropriate mitigating measures. Employees
in sensitive positions are also required to submit
declarations relating to anti-bribery compliance
yearly.
6. A separate TC evaluates and approves the award of
tenders for goods and services exceeding
S$50 million in value, except for those related
to new development projects and major
redevelopment projects at Changi Airport which
come under the purview of the ECAD. The TC
comprises the following Directors:
i. Mr Ng Chee Khern – Chairman
ii. Ms Kwa Kim Li

Internal Audit
7. IA assists the AC to ensure that the Company
maintains sound risk management and internal
control systems. IA is independent of the activities

areas, and undertakes investigations as directed
by the AC. It comprises suitably qualified and
experienced staff, headed by the Senior Vice
President, Internal Audit (SVP, IA). SVP, IA
reports functionally to the Chairman of the AC,
and administratively to the CEO. To ensure the
independence of the IA function, the IA team has
unrestricted access to the AC.
8. IA adopts a risk-based approach in formulating its
annual audit plan that aligns its activities to the key
risks across the Company’s businesses, focusing on
key internal controls, including financial, operational
and compliance controls. The annual audit plan is
developed in consultation with, but is independent
of, Management and is approved by the AC. IA
also works closely with Management to provide
internal consulting and control advisory to promote
effective risk management, robust internal control
and good governance practices in the development
of new services / products and the implementation
of new / enhanced systems and processes. IA also
CHANGI AIRPORT GROUP 69
harnesses technology to maximise efficiencies in the
way it audits, through robust use of analytics and
continuous auditing.
9. In line with best practices, IA has a quality assurance
and improvement programme (QAIP) that covers
its audit activity and conforms to the International
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal
Auditing. Internal Quality Assurance Reviews (QAR)
are conducted half-yearly, and external QAR are
carried out at least once every five years by qualified
professionals from an external organisation, which
in 2023, Deloitte & Touche Enterprise Risk Services
Pte Ltd (“DT”) was appointed to conduct the
external QAR.
10.IA’s assessments on the adequacy and effectiveness
of internal controls over processes / systems
across the businesses are reported to the AC, and a
summary of key findings and recommendations are
also discussed at the AC meetings. IA also tracks
and reports to the AC on the implementation status
of actions agreed by Management, so as to ensure
prompt and adequate closure of audit observations.

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE
1. CAG continues to strengthen its risk governance and
remains steadfast to its commitment to minimise key
risks as well as the impact of damage through timely
risk identification and implementation of appropriate
mitigation strategies.
2. In financial year 2023/24, CAG continued its efforts
to rebuild the Changi air hub and airport business.
Passenger traffic at Changi Airport returned to pre-
Covid levels by the end of the year. Amidst a tight
labour market, CAG embarked on trials to transform
airport operations to future-proof Changi. The full
reopening of Terminal 2 in November 2023 also
enabled the airport to accommodate the increase in
passenger traffic.
3. CAG also forged ahead with its plans to transit
to renewable energy. It navigated through
macroeconomic headwinds, which saw subdued
consumer spending compounded by rising operating
costs. Despite the challenges, CAG ensured that
Changi Airport continued to operate safely, securely
and efficiently.
Risk Governance
4. The CAG Board and Management are responsible
for the management of risks in Changi Airport.
The Board, through the Operational Risk & Safety
Committee (ORSC), provides oversight on operational
and safety risks, while the review of the Company’s
financial and strategic risks is overseen by the Audit
Committee (AC).
5. The ORSC comprises three Directors and two co-
opted members, who provide additional advice and
expertise to the Committee.
6. The three Directors are / were:
BG Kelvin Fan – Chairman
(stepped down on 21 March 2024)
Ms Kwa Kim Li
Mr Abdul Wahab Bin Mohamed Yusoff
The two co-opted members are:
Mr Mike Barclay
Mr Wong Woon Liong
7. The Board Committees work with the Management
to ensure effective allocation of resources to
create and protect CAG’s assets and value. At
the Management level, the Management Risk
Committee (RC) is responsible for monitoring the
risk management and internal control systems
and ensuring that emerging risks are managed
appropriately. The RC is chaired by the CEO
and comprises Senior Management members of
the Company. It meets regularly to review the
Company’s key risks and provides strategic guidance
to reinforce the implementation of enterprise risk
management within the Company as needed.
8. The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) unit supports
the Board Committees and Management in their
management of risks within CAG. The ERM unit
carries out global risk scanning efforts for emerging
risks to keep mitigation strategies timely and relevant.
It also works closely with the programme office to
monitor the Changi East project comprising the
future Terminal 5, connecting tunnels, and the three-
runway system to ensure that risk factors across
the design and construction phases, such as safety,
operations, scheduling and cost, are mitigated to
achieve optimal project outcomes.
Risk Awareness Culture
9. Risk management is an integral part of CAG’s culture.
Every employee is to function as a risk manager for
his or her own area of work by being vigilant and
reporting risks in a timely manner. The ERM unit
continues to equip its network of risk management
champions to promote a more robust risk-aware
culture across CAG and enhance risk-considered
decision making.
10.The ERM unit continues to meet with risk owners
regularly to ensure that risks are adequately
addressed. It is involved in key committees such as
the Information Assurance Committee and the Safety
Committee, and will continue to work alongside
business units to provide risk advisory to help them
meet their business objectives amid challenging
headwinds.
Strengthening Cybersecurity
11.CAG has a Cybersecurity and Digital Governance
division to oversee cybersecurity with an enterprise-
wide vision, strategy and programme. In 2023/24, it
expanded its cybersecurity awareness programme
to instil a strong culture of vigilance and active threat
detection among its employees. It also demonstrated
its commitment to information security by obtaining
both ISO 27001 certification and Cyber Trust mark for
its largest online store, iShopChangi. CAG continues to
strengthen its digital security and resilience to ensure a
safer cyberspace for customers and passengers.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our Opinion
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.
(the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) and the balance sheet of the Company are properly drawn up in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards
(International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the
financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2024 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated
changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the financial year ended on that date.
What we have audited
The financial statements of the Company and the Group comprise:
• the consolidated income statement of the Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2024;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of the Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2024;
• the balance sheets of the Company and the Group as at 31 March 2024;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group for the financial year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the financial year then ended; and

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of
Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.

AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Member of Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.
Our Audit Approach
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the
accompanying financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements;
for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future
events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of
internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
Property, Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)
The Group invests significantly into its capital
infrastructure assets to support the growth and
ongoing operations of the Singapore Changi Airport
and Singapore as an air hub. Whilst the development of
Terminal 5 (“T5”) was temporarily paused in 2020 as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, construction of the
terminal is expected to start in 2025, with completion
planned in phases. Works on other areas of the Changi
East (“CE”) such as the Three runway system and tunnels
continues during the financial year.
The Group’s total additions to PPE, including those
relating to CE, amounted to $833 million during the
financial year (Note 11*). We focused our audit on the
accounting for additions to PPE for the CE project as the
additions are material to the financial statements of the
Group.
At the end of the financial year, management estimates
the progress of construction or development works
that have not been billed by suppliers and contractors
and accrues for the unbilled PPE under construction.
Estimates of percentage of completion of construction
are made based on certified progress reports from the
suppliers and contractors.
We performed a walkthrough of the procurement and
fixed assets capitalisation cycle and evaluated the
design, implementation and operating effectiveness
of key internal controls over payments, accruals and
capitalisation of PPE additions.
In respect of the additions to PPE arising from suppliers
and contractors, we selected samples of the additions
and verified that they were appropriately supported by
the relevant supplier invoices. For accrued balances, we
sighted the relevant certified progress reports to support
the appropriateness of the accrued amounts.
We also checked that payments of invoices and progress
reports used for accrual of unbilled PPE construction
costs were approved by management in accordance with
the Delegation of Authority set out by the Board.
For capitalised employee compensation, we selected
samples to verify that only employee compensation for
employees working for construction or development
works directly attributable to PPE were capitalised. We
also assessed management’s internal cost allocation to
the relevant assets for appropriateness.
We also sighted on a sampling basis, construction-in-
progress assets to verify the existence of asset additions.

Group’s PPE balances.

Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Statement (but
does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this
auditor’s report, and the other sections of the annual report (“the Other Sections”), which are expected to be made
available to us after that date.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified
above and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s
report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
When we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to
communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Member of Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.
Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance
with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised
use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible
for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our
audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by theAct to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary
corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors, have been properly kept in accordance with the
provisions of the Act.

This section explains the calculation boundaries, methodologies and assumptions used in the preparation of CAG’s
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The carbon footprint is prepared in accordance with ISO 14064-1:2018, Greenhouse
Gas (GHG) Protocol and the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) guidelines.
Reporting scope and period
CAG uses an adaptation of the Operational Control Approach, where the company accounts for 100% of the GHG
emissions from operations over which it has control. Following requirements for Level 3 “Optimisation” Airport
Carbon Accreditation, this carbon footprint takes into account the sources and activities controlled by CAG,
namely, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, as well as sources that CAG can guide or influence through effective
partnership (Scope 3 GHG emissions). CAG focuses on calculating carbon dioxide (CO2
) emissions for all three
scopes.
Data for GHG emission calculations includes Terminals 1 to 4, as well as emissions under CAG’s direct operational
control (Scope 2) in Jewel Changi Airport Trustee Pte Ltd (JCAT). Electricity onsold to JCAT as a private developer is
included in CAG’s Scope 3 emissions.
CAG’s energy and emissions data is externally verified on an annual basis. In this report, CAG’s energy and
emissions data for FY23/24 have been disclosed with verified FY19/20, FY20/21, FY21/22 and FY22/23 data for
comparability.
Calculation methodologies
Our methodologies are consistent with the ACI Guidance Manual on Airport Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Management and the GHG Protocol. Emissions are divided according to ownership and control of the source.
Scope 1
Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions which occur from sources owned or controlled by CAG. This
includes emissions from both stationary sources (power generators, electrical switchgears and other stationary
equipment) and mobile sources (company-owned vehicles and heavy-duty equipment). Activities and process
emissions from firefighting exercises are also included.
The quantity of Scope 1 GHG emissions is calculated by multiplying activity data by their respective emission
factors. Activity data was obtained from procurement invoices and operational records.
ANNEX: GHG EMISSIONS
QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGY
ANNUAL REPORT 2023/24
88
Scope 2
Scope 3
References for emission factors
Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions which occur from the generation of purchased electricity
consumed by CAG.
The quantity of Scope 2 GHG emissions is calculated by multiplying electricity usage (in kWh) by the national
grid emission factor. Data for electricity usage was obtained from receipts issued by the electricity supplier.
The grid emission factor used is released by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) in accordance with the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) guidelines.
Scope 3 emissions are other indirect GHG emissions that are a consequence of CAG’s activities but occur at
sources not owned or controlled by CAG. Due to the variety of Scope 3 GHG emission sources within scope, a
range of methodologies has been used.
For emissions resulting from activities involving aircraft (landing and takeoff cycle, engine test-run and aircraft
auxiliary power unit), the Airports Council International (ACI), Airport Carbon and Emissions Reporting Tool
is used. For emissions resulting from ground activities that are carried out by our partners (ground support
equipment, surface access, electricity resold, waste management), a similar calculation approach used for
quantifying Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions is used. Emissions from the shuttle bus operations are calculated
with the use of the GHG Emissions Calculation Tool. Finally, for business travel, the International Civil Aviation
Organization Carbon Emissions Calculator is used. For every calculation tool/model used, CAG has applied
suitable assumptions to the input data. Refer to the table below for the respective emission factors used.
